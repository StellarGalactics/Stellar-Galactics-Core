# Stellar Galactics Game

Stellar Galactics Game is an idle auto-battler with the psychological stress of asteroid mining. The game is built on Solana and is playable on Mobile and Browsers. The game involves minting and managing in-game Cyborg NFTs, sending them on asteroid mining/looting missions, and relieving their stress by visiting Zion. 

It was started as the flagship game of Stellar Galactics, a Solana NFT collection. Sadly, amidst co-founder conflicts, we'll be ceasing operations. While it aches our hearts to shout-down operations, weâ€™ve always been community first, and to honor our commitment to the community, we have decided to open-source our game code and blender files. By doing so, we hope to empower others to build upon our work and further advance the web3 gaming ecosystem.

You can access all of the Blender files used for asset creation [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1QFpQHApEZSufYxGNhFtJ8M9XsO4lcPL0?usp=sharing).
