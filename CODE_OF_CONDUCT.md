### Code of Conduct for Stellar Galactics

#### Our Pledge
In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone.

#### Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

#### Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

#### Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces, and it also applies when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

#### Enforcement
Since Stellar Galactics is ceasing operations, the original team will not be available to enforce this Code of Conduct. We encourage the community to maintain these standards independently and to foster a respectful and inclusive environment for all participants.

#### Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.1.

We hope this code helps others to learn from and build upon our work in a respectful and inclusive manner.
